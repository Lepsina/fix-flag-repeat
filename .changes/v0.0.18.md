## v0.0.18 - 2025-03-14
### Added
* Add new target into Makefile - install
* New --cleanup-on-exit flag for `ydbops restart`. If specified, will intercept SIGTERM\SIGINT, safely finish current CMS batch and exit, cleaning up request
### Changed
* bumped Go version to 1.23
### Removed
* Removed an unimplemented --continue flag. Turned out it's not necessary, filtering by uptime etc is expressive and much simpler
### Fixed
* 'delay-between-restarts' applies between CMS batches as well
* Returned forgotten bracket in <subcommand> help message
